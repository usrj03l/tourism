              Thiruananthapuram, the jewel in the emerald necklace that Kerala is for the Indian sub-continent, must surely have Parasuramanbeen a “must see” destination for ages, long before National
              Geographic Traveller classified it as one. Surely long before Sage Parasurama , according to local legend, threw his divine battle axe from Kanyakumari to Gokarnam to west Kerala, God’s
              own land, from the Varuna the sea god; before the times of Mahabali the democratic and just ruler of this wonderful land who was sent down to the netherworld through deceit. It doesnt
              take any flights of fancy to imagine that this land fired the imaginations of intrepid travellers and explorers like Columbus, Vasco da Gama, Marco Polo, Fa Hien, and quite possibly,
              countless others from the pages of history, recorded or not. <br /><br />

              Thiruvananthapuram, or Trivandrum, as it was conveniently re-christened by the English, is the southern-most district and Thiruvananthapuram city is the district headquarters as well as
              the State capital of Kerala. Thiru Anantha Puram, or the city of the Holy Anantha, is named after Ananthan, the cosmic serpent with a thousand heads, on whose coils Lord Mahavishnu
              reclines. This iconic representation is the chief deity in the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple. The temple was built by King Marthanda Varma of the Travancore Royal family when, in 1745, he
              shifted the Travancore capital from Padmanabhapuram in the south (today in the neighbouring State of Tamil Nadu) to Thiruvananthapuramand started reigning as ‘Padmanabha Dasa’, the
              servant and representative of Lord Padmanabha–perhaps a nobler variant of the ‘Divine Right Theory’ that the West is familiar with . The vast temple complex, with its tall ‘Gopuram’
              decorated with detailed carvings reflected in the huge temple tank, is today a centre of attraction for the pious, the tourist and the merely curious.
