              Thrissur is known as the cultural capital of Kerala, and the land of Poorams. Thrissur is a revenue district of Kerala situated in the central part of that state. Spanning an area of
              about 3,032 km2, Thrissur district is home to over 10% of Kerala’s population. Thrissur district is bordered by the districts of Palakkad and Malappuram to the north, and the districts
              of Ernakulam and Idukki to the south. <br /><br />

              The District can claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period. It can also claim to
              have played an important part in fostering cultural relations and in laying the foundation of a cosmopolitan and compose culture in this part of the country. Kodungalloor which had the
              unique distinction of being the “Primum Emporium India”, also belongs to the signal honour of having first given shelter to all the three communities which have contributed to the
              prosperity of Malabar’. These three communities are the Christians, the Jews and the Muslims. <br /><br />
